#Loops are 
#Common Uses in DSA

#1. Traversing arrays/lists
#2. Counting, summing, searching
#3. Reversing strings/numbers
#4. Pattern printing (triangles, pyramids, etc.)
#5. Implementing algorithms (binary search, BFS/DFS, sorting, etc.)


#1. for → best for fixed iterations (lists, strings, range)
#2. while → best when condition-based looping needed
#3. break, continue, pass, else give extra control
#4. Nested loops help with multi-dimensional problems
